This creates a single entry point, to connect to the Julia process and load dependencies. For Documenter, the page needs to be set to exportable=true, offline=true. Exportable has the effect of inlining all data & js dependencies, so that everything can be loaded in a single HTML object. offline=true will make the Page not even try to connect to a running Julia process, which makes sense for the kind of static export we do in Documenter.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using JSServe\nPage(exportable=true, offline=true)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"After the page got displayed by the frontend, we can start with creating plots and JSServe Apps:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using WGLMakie\n# Set the default resolution to something that fits the Documenter theme\nset_theme!(resolution=(800, 400))\nscatter(1:4, color=1:4)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"As you can see, the output is completely static, because we don't have a running Julia server, as it would be the case with e.g. Pluto.
